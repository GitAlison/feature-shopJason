      We know you worry about your money and where you put it into and often ask yourself ”How do i get my money back if this does not work ?“. 
      <br>
      Stop worrying because we’ve got you covered. Because we are farmers ourselves and all our products are lab tested, we trust our products and know you will love them and because we are smokers and users of cannabis and cannabis products in various ways, 
      we trust our services and the bond between us and our customers. However, If you don’t like the product, if it just doesn’t work for you, return it and we will refund you the full amount except the $30 shipping fee as this payment goes directly to the courier company.

      How Does This Work ?
      To request for a refund, simply fill in and submit the form to the right. Regardless of your method of payment, refund will be made directly to your bank account by our bank which is Wells Fargo.
      
      When you request for refund, it will take within 24-48 hours for your refund to be processed after which you will receive an email and text message directly from our bank (Wells Fargo) with an exact date on which your refund will appear into your account
      
      Please confirm to us via email at Sale.potsandbuds@gmail.com when you receive your confirmation email and text from our bank so that we know your refund has been confirmed
      
      Note that irrespective of your payment method, refund comes directly to your bank account, PayPal or Cash App account within the time given by our bank and if you made any prior attempts to cancel or dispute a payment after package had been mailed out then we will NOT refund
